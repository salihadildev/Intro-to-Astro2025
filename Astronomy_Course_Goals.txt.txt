By completing this course, I aim to acquire the skills needed to quickly adapt to new astronomy research projects. During this process, I have a keen interest in the topics of dark energy and exoplanets. This course will provide me with in-depth knowledge in these areas and prepare me to a level suitable for an internship in astronomy research. This opportunity will also create an excellent foundation for my undergraduate studies.
