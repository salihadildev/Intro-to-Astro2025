    "- An OS facilitates the interface between hardware and software on your machine, and lets the user interact with the machine\n",
    "- It was written in 1971, entirely in the C programming language\n",
    "- It is extremely fast for repetitive tasks and is widely used for distributed applications\n",
    "- MacOS works on Unix. Linux is also a Unix-like alternative"

    "\n",
    "- As Unix is an OS, the Unix shell is both a **command-line interface (CLI)** and a **scripting language**, which the users interact with\n",
    "- So, shell is a program where users can type commands (in a syntax)\n",
    "- BASH (Bourne Again SHell) is the most popular implementation of the Unix shell\n",
    "- We can combine these commands into a sequences or pipelines, called **scripts**, and accomplish larger tasks\n",
    "- Mac OS' `Terminal` provides a command-line interface for passing commands to Unix\n",
    "    - Linux also has a Unix-like implementation\n",
    "    - For windows users, you can either install a [Git Shell](https://carpentries.github.io/workshop-template/#shell), or install a [Linux Subsystem for Windows (WSL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)\n",
    "    - In this Jupyter notebook, we can also use the magic command `%%bash` to make a Unix-like cell"
