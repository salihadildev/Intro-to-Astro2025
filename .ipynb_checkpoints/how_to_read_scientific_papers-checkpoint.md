# How to Read Scientific Papers

by Isabel Angelo, Sarah Blunt & Tim Holt (2018, updated 2022)

In this introduction, we suggest some techniques for effectively reading a scientific paper. We also provide resources that are commonly used in astronomy to make finding, reading, and storing papers much easier.

## Finding Scientific Papers:
Use the Astrophysics Data System or ADS:

https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu

ADS is a database where journal articles in astrophysics are stored. You can query the database by typing in the author, title, or other relevant information about a paper. The search engine will return a list of matches to your search, from which you can find the paper you are looking for.

Use the ADS to find the discovery paper for your favorite exoplanet system using the ADS, write a brief description of the article in your own words. You should also copy the LaTax citation or store the article in the citation manager of your choice.

## Downloading and Storing Papers:
Mendeley is a great application to track the many scientific papers that you will use throughout your careers.

Mendeley allows you to download papers and keep them stored in a single, organized library on your own computer. You can also sort papers into cetegories and annotate them (similar to google docs) so you can have notes, definitions, etc. on-hand.

## Closely Reading Science Papers:

For your assignment this week, please read the paper of the week thoroughly (Lee, 2018  https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.08907). Try to observe the following note-taking strategy (or use something similar that works for you!):

- Highlight words you don't know in one color. Look up their definitions and write them down as in-text notes as you read.
- Highlight key ideas in another color.
- Keep a general note with summaries of each paragraph
- Keep a general note with summaries of each section
- Keep a note with 10-word or less summaries of each figure
- Keep a note with overall questions you have about the paper. Some of these you may resolve as you read-- once you've finished reading the paper, revisit this note and see how many of your own questions you can answer!
