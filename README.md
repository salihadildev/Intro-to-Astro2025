## First Meeting: July 1st, 2025: 6:00pm Universal Time.


## Agenda:
* Introductions
* Tutorial on Unix, Shell, Shell Script
* How to read scientific papers (ADS, Mendeley, arXiv)


## Assignments for Week 1

### If you have not already:
 * Ensure that you have a working version of Python installed on your computer.
   * [This link](https://carpentries.github.io/workshop-template/#python) has a section for downloading the Anaconda version of Python for Mac, Linux, or Windows
 * Finish writing your goals for this program if you did not finish during the session.

### Assignment 1) Go through the slides for Unix and complete the 2 assignments written there
1. Perform a set of commands mentioned in the slides/python notebook
2. Complete the Unix Workbench and Data Carpentry workshop on the Unix command shell
The Unix shell is the basis for scientific computing. By mastering shell commands, you will save
yourself hours in the future. What seems like a small investment will pay dividends again and again.

**Deliverable:**
  On Google Drive, you can send a file having list of all of the Unix commands that you learned, with a brief description of each.


### Paper of the week: Assignment 2) Read this exoplanet review paper:

* Download and read the four papers mentioned at the end of Philip's presentation.
* Answer the questions: "Which paper proposes a novel method that could be utilized to attract the attention of, and ultimately communicate with, extraterrestrial intelligence?"
* Post at least one other question to Discord, and respond to at least one of your classmates' questions.

### Bonus Round (Intended for everyone. See how far you can get)
Command line Ninjas begin their training with the simplest commands they use every day and eventually obtain
more and more skills. Follow the link below and see how far you get in the command-line challenge. Be sure to
keep track of your progress so that you can report back.
